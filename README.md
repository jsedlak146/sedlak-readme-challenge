For this challenge, we were instructed to create a ReadMe generator using Javascript, inquirer and Node.js.  Below are the links to my GitHub repo and my video demonstration.

## Installation

I began by running my NPM and installing inquirer.  Then I began including the packages I would be needing to complete the project.  Next I wrote an array of questions to take all of our user input and actually make the content of the ReadMe. After that, I made two functions, one to write the readMe file and another to initialize the application. Finally, I created a function in my markdown that returns a license badge, link and section then a function to generate the markdown data for the ReadMe. 

## Usage

To use the application, first open the file in your integrated terminal. Type in "node index" and press enter.  Then simply answer all of the prompts and watch your ReadMe generate!
